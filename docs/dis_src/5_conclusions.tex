\chapter{Conclusions}

This project was a great success

\section{Lessons learned}

Testing is good.

Rust is great.

OCaml is nice but sometimes messy. Lack of documentation is bad. Trace comparison is good.

JITs are fun.

Stack unwinding is a mess on Unix.

\section{Possible extensions}

More sophisticated analysis for the optimising compiler. eg. detect floats.

Extending cranelift to support tail calls.

Experimenting with specialising at the closure level.

Better thresholds for when to optimise a function.

Replace recursion with direct calls.
